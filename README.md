# Cards
An app written with SwiftUI and CoreData frameworks, to manage personal bank Cards.

# Overview
This repository contains a simple iOS app built using Swift, SwiftUI, and CoreData.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the my knowledge of the Swift programming language and the use of SwiftUI and CoreData frameworks
to create a basic card management application. Throughout this project, gained valuable insights into
dataflow, attributes in SwiftUI, data persistence, custom function creation, and data modeling.

# Key Learnings

Data Flow: The project provided an opportunity to explore data flow concepts in SwiftUI, understanding how data is passed between views and how it affects the user interface.

Attributes: The project involved working with various SwiftUI attributes.

Modifiers: The project involved working with various SwiftUI modifiers.

Data Persistence: CoreData framework was used to implement data persistence, allowing users to store and manage their card and transaction data securely.

Custom Functions: Created some custom functions to enhance the app's functionality, demonstrating the ability to extend SwiftUI to meet specific requirements.

Data Modeling: Models for card and transaction data were designed and implemented, gaining valuable experience in structuring data for efficient management.

# About the App

The Cards app is a practical tool designed to help users manage their cards and related transactions. It simplifies the process of keeping track of cards by allowing users to:

Add, edit, and delete card entries

Record transactions associated with each card

View a detailed transaction history for each card
