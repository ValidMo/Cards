# Swifty Cards

An app using SwiftUI and CoreData frameworks, to manage personal bank cards.

# Overview
This repository contains a simple iOS app built using Swift, SwiftUI, and CoreData.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge about Swift programming language, SwiftUI and CoreData frameworks
to create a basic card management application. Throughout this project, gained valuable insights into
dataflow, attributes in SwiftUI, data persistence, custom function creation, and data modeling.

# Key Learnings

Data Flow: The project provided an opportunity to explore data flow concepts in SwiftUI, understanding how data is passed between views and how it affects the user interface.

Attributes: The project involved working with various SwiftUI attributes.

Data Persistence: CoreData framework was used to implement data persistence, allowing users to store and manage their card and transaction data securely.

Custom Functions: Created some custom functions to enhance the app's functionality, demonstrating the ability to extend SwiftUI to meet specific requirements.

Data Modeling: Models for card and transaction data were designed and implemented, gaining valuable experience in structuring data for efficient management.

Modifiers: The project involved working with various SwiftUI modifiers.

# About the App

The Swifty Cards app is a practical tool designed to help users manage their cards and related transactions. It simplifies the process of keeping track of cards by allowing users to:

Add, edit, and delete card entries

Record transactions associated with each card

View a detailed transaction history for each card
